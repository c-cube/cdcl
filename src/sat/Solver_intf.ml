  (** [Consequence (l, p)] means that the formulas in [l] imply the propagated
      formula [f]. The proof should be a proof of the clause "[l] implies [f]".

      invariant: in [Consequence (fun () -> l,p)], all elements of [l] must be true in
      the current trail.

      {b note} on lazyiness: the justification is suspended (using [unit -> â€¦])
      to avoid potentially costly computations that might never be used
      if this literal is backtracked without participating in a conflict.
      Therefore the function that produces [(l,p)] needs only be safe in
      trails (partial models) that are conservative extensions of the current
      trail.
      If the theory isn't robust w.r.t. extensions of the trail (e.g. if
      its internal state undergoes significant changes),
      it can be easier to produce the explanation eagerly when
      propagating, and then use [Consequence (fun () -> expl, proof)] with
      the already produced [(expl,proof)] tuple.
